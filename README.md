# Skylight

A light table for photos stored in the cloud.

## About the name

In photography, a light table is a viewing device that is used to review photographic film placed on top of it. A horizontal form of a self-standing lightbox (a translucent surface illuminated from behind, used for situations where a shape laid upon the surface needs to be seen with high contrast), it provides even illumination of the subject from below through a translucent cover and fluorescent lights. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_table)

A skylight is a window in the roof of a building that lets through light from outside and allows to see the sky and clouds outside.

As online photos are stored in "the cloud", a skylight can be seen as the equivalent of a light table for online photos.
